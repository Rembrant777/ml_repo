# you need to pip install jupyter first 
# then set up jupyter by run jupyter lab command in your iterm(mac book/mac air)
# then pip install openai 
# make user you have an open ai account 
# then apply(to generate) your api key on https://platform.openai.com/ key api page 
# then sync your api key to your current environment variables with name = OPENAI_API_KEY
# then begin the following python coding

# request all the models from openai remote service

# print all the models in a list 
#print(models)


# prepare your dataset and organized them in speicified format pattern 
# then directly exeucte the following command on your jupyter 
# and you need to specify the customized model name  
!openai api fine_tunes.create -t ./dataset/finetune_dataset1.txt  -m davinci --suffix 'davinci_model_002'

# you will get a fine_tune_job_id from the response message above that begin with the key word ft-xxxx 
fine_tune_job_id_001 = "ft-xxxx"

# then execute the command directly in your jupyter you will get the your customized trained models' status   
!openai api fine_tunes.follow -i $fine_tune_job_id_001

# and the trained result (success or not )
!openai api fine_tunes.results -i $fine_tune_job_id_001

# then you will get your complete model name from the above opanai command's response content
# set it to the variable model
