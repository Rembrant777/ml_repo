# Facenet in Pytorch 

* This project has been refactored based on [facenet](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet) and [facenet-pytorch](https://github.com/timesler/facenet-pytorch). It includes added comments and adds unit tests and benchmark performance testing code to methods that were previousl lacking them. 

* This project is more oriented torwards self-learning and understand. If you intend to use or further develop it, please refer to the original project as a priority. If you have any questions or want to contribute, please submit an issue or leave a message in the discussion area.
